            But there is good news. <br><br>

              <p>They are focused on helping me achieve my goals and make every session challenging (& somehow fun). My fitness has increased noticeably and I’ve seen improvements in my ability to complete more sit ups / core exercises, lift progressively heavier weights & generally push myself harder throughout each session. I find I actually look forward to my workouts.</p>
